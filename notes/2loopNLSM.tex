\title{Towards Globally Color-Dual All-Loop Integrands}

\abstract{ For now, let's put the things we need to check/compute here in the abstract. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does our construction manifest all the cuts for the two-loop n-gon?
\item What is the physics story here? Perturbative corrections to special Galilon, DBI for inflation? 
\item How can bubble on external legs that are zero by IBP inform generalizations beyond pions?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Review}
The goal is this paper is to compute $D$-dimensional color-dual numerators beyond one-loop. To this end compute two-loop color-dual numerators for NLSM that globally satisfy the duality between color and kinematics and elucidate the color-dual structure expected of Yang-Mills at all-loop order. To set the stage, it is worth distinguishing between the algebraic properties of functionally symmetric kinematics that satisfy color-kinematics globally, and some of the other constructions that appear in the literature. 

In this work, we will consider three different types of cubic representations, that we define below: 
\be
\stackrel{\Acubic{hgrey0}{}{nhpRed}{}{nhpRed}{fermion2}{}}{\text{Fundamental}}\qquad\qquad \stackrel{\cubic{hgrey0}{fermion2}{}{fermion2}{}{fermion2}{}}{\text{Bifundamental}}\qquad\qquad \stackrel{\Acubic{hgrey0}{}{nhpBlue}{}{nhpBlue}{}{nhpBlue}}{\text{Adjoint}}
\ee
In this review, we will present examples of this distinct kinematic representations that have appeared in the literature. Though from the get go, we stress that in this work we are interested in identifying the analog of adjoint representations of the kinematic numerators; those for which all legs are equally preferrenced by the functional dressing. The only non-trivial $S$-matrix in the literature that exhibits this property to all-loop order, is that of Zakharov-Mikhailov theory \cite{}. We will briefly review the perturbative construction of this theory below. 
\subsection{Self-dual Yang-Mills}
\be
\mathcal{L}^{\text{YM}} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
\ee
To obtain the Lagrangian for self-dual Yang-Mills, we applyy the self-dual condition that equates the field strength to its dual 2-form:
\be\label{SDcon}
F_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F^{\rho\sigma}
\ee
where $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu -\partial_\nu A_\mu + g[A_\mu ,A_\nu]$ is the non-abelian $SU(N)$ field strength. Transforming from Cartesian coordinates to light cone coordinantes, $(t,x,y,z) \rightarrow (u,v,w,\bar{w})$, which take the following definition:
\be
u = t+x,\quad v=t-x, \quad w = y+iz
\ee
which gives the following expression for the invariant line element:
\be
ds^2 = 2(dudv - dwd\bar{w}) = dt^2 - d\vec{x}\cdot d\vec{x}
\ee
Applying this coordinate transformation to the self-dual condition of \eqn{SDcon}, in light-cone gauge, $A_u=0$, we obtain the follow set of equations that are one-to-one with the 4D self-dual condition:
\be
A_w = 0\,, \qquad \partial_u A_v = \partial_w A_{\bar{w}}\,.
\ee
The second equation implies the following that $A_v$ and $A_{\bar{w}}$ depend on a single degree of freedom, which we call $\Psi$. This constraint is immediately satisfied with the following definition of the gauge field:
\be
A_v = \frac{1}{2} \partial_w \Psi, \qquad A_{\bar{w}} = \frac{1}{2} \partial_u \Psi,
\ee
Expanding out the equations of motion for the Yang-Mills Lagrangian, yields the following expression in terms of the gauge fields:
\be
D^\mu F^{\mu\nu} =0\qquad  \Rightarrow\qquad \Box \Psi + ig [\partial_u \Psi, \partial_w \Psi ]=0
\ee
Adding back in the anti-holomorphic field $\bar{\Psi}$ as a Lagrange multiplier, we obtain the following interaction Lagrangian for self-dual Yang-Mills theory:
\be
\mathcal{L}^{\text{SDYM}} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial \bar{\Psi})(\partial \Psi) -i g \bar{\Psi} [\partial_u \Psi, \partial_w \Psi ]
\ee
\subsection{ZM-theory} The Lagrangian for Zakharov-Mikhailov (ZM) theory is a simple $SU(N)$ scalar theory defined in two spacetime dimensions:
\be
\mathcal{L}^{\text{ZM}} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial \varphi)^2 + g f^{abc} \varphi^a (\partial^\mu \varphi^b)( \tilde{\partial}_\mu \varphi^c) 
\ee
where $\tilde{\partial}_\mu = \epsilon_{\mu\nu}\partial^\nu $ and $\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$ is the two-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol. Expanded out into spacetime components, the momentum space Feynman rule for this theory is simply:
\be
\langle ab\rangle \equiv p_a^0 p_b^1 - p_a^1 p_b^0 = -\langle ba \rangle 
\ee
 From the interaction part of the Lagrangian, we can see that the three-point vertex is (1) functionally symmetric and (2) the kinematics are completely anti-symmetric: 
\be
\cubic{hgrey0}{}{nhpBlue}{}{nhpBlue}{}{nhpBlue} = \langle 12\rangle = \langle 23\rangle = \langle 31\rangle = -\langle 21\rangle
\ee
This important property is due to momentum conservation alone and does not need any additional kinematic constraints to satisfy the duality. In addition to anti-symmetry, the cubic graphs will satisfy jacobi off-shell on any internal edge due to the delta function identity of 2D Levi-Civita symbols:
\be
\langle ab \rangle \langle cd\rangle +\langle ac \rangle \langle db\rangle +\langle ad \rangle \langle bc\rangle = \delta^{[a}_c\delta^{b]}_d + \delta^{[a}_d\delta^{c]}_b+ \delta^{[a}_b\delta^{d]}_c=0
\ee
Theories with this property are the creme de la creme of color-dual gauge theories as they trivially satisfy color-kinematic algebraic relations off-shell. This allows one to trivially promote the duality from tree-level to all-loop order by dressing each cubic vertex with its own kinematic structure constant. 

Later in this section we will show that the interaction vertex is precisely that belonging to self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory in light-cone gauge. However, as we'll see, the kinetic term for these two theories differ -- the SDYM kinetic term transmutes between the holomorphic field $\Phi$, and the anti-holomorphic field, $\bar{\Phi}$, while the ZM scalar leaves the kinematic sector untouched. this is a critical distinction between the two theories that has important consequences for their color-dual constructions at loop-level.

While the color-dual nature of ZM theory is rather elegant, the loop-level construction introduces complications when applying dimensional regularization. Similar to the difficulties of renormalizing chiral fermions \cite{ 'tHooft}, there is ambiguity in promoting the integrands to formal $D$-dimensional expressions. 
\subsection{YZ-Theory}
\be
\mathcal{L}^{\text{YZ}} =\frac{1}{2} (\partial Y)^2 + (\partial Z)(\partial \bar{Z}) - g f^{abc} \left( \bar{Z}_{\mu\nu}Z^{\mu} Z^\nu + [Y,\partial_\mu Y] Z^\mu \right)
\ee
\be
\Acubic{hgrey0}{}{nhpRed}{}{nhpRed}{fermion2}{} = i \varepsilon_3 (p_1-p_2)\qquad \cubic{hgrey0}{fermion2}{}{fermion2}{}{fermion2}{} =i(\varepsilon_1 p_{2})(\varepsilon_2\bar{\varepsilon}_3) - i(\varepsilon_2 p_{1})(\varepsilon_1\bar{\varepsilon}_3)
\ee
We begin with a review of the construction of NLSM numerators at tree-level. For this work we extend the tree-level construction of $Y\!Z$ model of Cheung and Hsien \cite{Cheung2016prv}. In this construction, the generators of the kinematic algebra can be expressed as follows
\be\label{eq:FeynmanRuleYYZ}
T^a_{ij}= i \varepsilon_a(p_i-p_j)
\ee
where momentum conservation requires
\be
p_a + p_i + p_j =0
\ee
The kinematic half-ladder diagrams then takes on the following concise definition:
\be
n^{\text{NLSM}}_{(i|a_1a_2...a_n|j)} = (T^{a_1}T^{a_2}\cdots T^{a_n})_{ij}
\ee
Since there are on pole cancelling factors of $s_{ij} = (p_i+p_j)^2$, this definition of the chiral current algebra is manifestly cubic. Thus, the kinematic structure constants defined in terms of these generators are invariant under generalized gauge freedom. They can be defined implicitly below:
\be
[T^a,T^b]_{ij}= F^{a}_{\,b|c}T^c_{ij}
\ee
Given this definition, the Feynman rule associated with kinematic structure constant is simply:
\be\label{eq:FeynmanRuleXZZ}
i F^{a}_{\,b|c} = (\varepsilon_b p_{ab})(\varepsilon_a\bar{\varepsilon}_c) - (\varepsilon_a p_{ab})(\varepsilon_b\bar{\varepsilon}_c) 
\ee
where $p_{ab}=p_a+p_b$ and $\epsilon$ and $\bar{\epsilon}$ are the polarizations of the $Z$-vectors particle and its conjugate field, respectively. The on-shell state sum for the polarization vectors is simply:
\be
\sum_{\text{states}} \varepsilon^{\,\mu}_{(p)}\bar{\varepsilon}^{\,\nu}_{(-p)} = \eta^{\mu\nu}
\ee
Notice that the vector state sum is gauge fixed since the $Y\,Z$ model explicitly chooses Lorenz gauge for the $Z$ particles, $\partial_\mu Z^\mu=0$. To recover NLSM amplitudes from this these kinematic structure constants at tree-level, we simply plug in the following on-shell polarizations for the $Z$ and $\bar{Z}$ particles:
\be\label{eq:onShellZStates}
\varepsilon^\mu_{(p)} = p^\mu \qquad \bar{\varepsilon}^\mu_{(p)} = \frac{q^\mu}{pq}
\ee
where $q^2=0$ is some null reference momentum. With this, we can define tree-level pion scattering in two equivalent ways:
\be
A^{\text{NLSM}} = A(...,Y,...,Y,...) = A(...,\bar{Z},...) 
\ee
where the ellipses denote additional on-shell $Z$-particles. Subject to a particular gauge choice, the kinematic numerators in latter definition for pion scattering is equivalent to those $J$-theory, first written down by Cheung and one of the authors \cite{Cheung:2021zvb}. In this paradigm, the on-shell $\bar{Z}$ state is equivalent to the root leg appearing in the color-dual $J$-theory numerators. 

It is instructive to see how both of these constructions produce valid tree-level amplitudes for the pion. First we'll start with two $Y$ particles on legs 1 and 4. Applying the Feynman rules above, and plugging in on-shell states for the $Z$-particles produces the following $s$- and $t$-channel numerators:
\begin{align}
n^{YY}_s &= (T^2T^3)_{14} = s_{12}^2 
\\
 n^{YY}_t &=  F^{3}_{\,2|X}T^X_{14}  = s_{14}(s_{13}-s_{12})
\end{align}
Plugging these numerators into the ordered amplitudes $A(s,t)$ yields the desired result:
\be\label{eq:NLSMYZ4point}
A^{YY}_{(s,t)} = \frac{n^{YY}_s}{s_{12}}+\frac{ n^{YY}_t }{s_{14}} = s_{13}
\ee
Similarly we can do the same for the $Z$ and $\bar{Z}$ configuration. Below we have plugged in the on-shell $Z$-particle states, but have left the $\bar{Z}$ index free. This produces the following numerators:
\begin{align}
n^{\bar{Z}Z}_s &= {}_4(F^{3}F^{2})_{1} =  s_{12}(s_{14}-s_{13})p_2^{\mu_1}+s_{12}^2(p_3-p_4)^{\mu_1}
\\
 n^{\bar{Z}Z}_t &=   {}_2(F^{3}F^{4})_{1}  = s_{14}(s_{12}-s_{13})p_4^{\mu_1}+s_{14}^2(p_3-p_2)^{\mu_1}
\end{align}
where we have defined the short hand notation:
\be
{}_x(F^{a_1}F^{a_2}\cdots F^{a_n})_{y} \equiv F^{a_1}_{\,x|b_2}F^{a_2}_{\,b_2|b_3}\cdots F^{a_n}_{\,b_n|y}
\ee
Similarly, we find the following ordered amplitude when plugging in these numerators:
\be
A^{\bar{Z}Z}_{(s,t)} = \frac{n^{\bar{Z}Z}_s}{s_{12}}+\frac{ n^{\bar{Z}Z}_t }{s_{14}} = -s_{13}(p_2+p_3+p_4)^{\mu_1} = s_{13} \,p_1^{\mu_1}
\ee
Plugging in the on-shell polarizatoin of the conjugate field in \eqn{eq:onShellZStates} produces precisely the desired result of \eqn{eq:NLSMYZ4point}. Indeed, this construction is valid to all orders at tree-level. There are only two possible factorization channels the contribute the each of these amplitudes, the $YY$ cut and the $\bar{Z}Z$ cut :
\begin{align}
A(...,Y,...,Y,...) &\rightarrow A(...,Y,...,Y)A(Y,...,Y,...)
\\
&\rightarrow A(...,Y,...,Y,...,Z)A(\bar{Z},...)
\end{align}
\subsection{J-theory}
\be
\mathcal{L}^{\text{J}} = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu J_\nu \bar{J}^{\mu\nu} +g f^{abc} \bar{J}_{\mu\nu}J^\mu J^\nu
\ee
where as above, $\bar{J}_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu J_\nu - \partial_\nu J_\mu$. Subject to the Lorenz gauge condition, $\partial_\mu J^\mu =0$, this Lagrangian produces precisely the EOM for J-theory needed for Berends-Giele recursion at tree-level: 
\be
\partial^2 J^\mu - gf^{abc} J^\nu \partial_\nu J^\mu = 0 
\ee
As such, the single vertex in this theory is the same as for YZ theory: 
\be
\cubic{hgrey0}{fermion2}{}{fermion2}{}{fermion2}{} =i(\varepsilon_1 p_{2})(\varepsilon_2\bar{\varepsilon}_3) - i(\varepsilon_2 p_{1})(\varepsilon_1\bar{\varepsilon}_3)
\ee

\be
\mathcal{L}^{\text{SDYM}} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial \bar{\Phi} )^a(\partial  \Phi)^a +g f^{abc} \bar{\Phi} ^a (\partial_u \Phi)^b (\partial_v \Phi)^c
\ee
\be
(\varepsilon^+_1 k_2) - (\varepsilon^+_2 k_1) = [12]\left(\frac{\langle 2 q\rangle}{\langle 1 q\rangle} + \frac{\langle 1 q\rangle}{\langle 2 q\rangle} \right) \sim [12]
\ee
Now we are prepared to discuss the one-loop case. 

\section{One-loop}

\subsection{NLSM -- Nic}

\draftnoteJM{I've explicitly checked the nice form of the 1-loop numerators at 4pt, 6pt, and 8pt.}

\be
\simplebox = (2 f_\pi^{-1})^4 (l_1 k_1)(l_2 k_2)(l_3 k_3)(l_4 k_4)
\ee
where we define sequential loop momenta on the $n$-gon as $l_{i+1}= l_i+k_i$. Given this, the $n$-gon permits a equivalent expression in terms of inverse propagators:
\be
\simplebox =f_\pi^{-4} [12][23][34][41]
\ee
Where we have define the antisymmetric kinematic variable, $[LR] = l_i^L - l_R^2$
\subsection{BELs and integration zeros -- Nic}

At one-loop, weight counting tells us that the $n$-gon master numerator must have $n$ on-shell $Z$-particles. Unitarity requires that there are three distinct contributions from $Y\!Z$ theory -- the first from an off-shell $Y$-loop particle and then two more from different orientations of a $\bar{Z}Z$-loop.  Thus, $Y\!Z$ theory gives us the following one-loop $n$-gon numerator:
\be
N^{n\text{-gon},YZ}_{(12...n)} = (T^{1}T^{2}\cdots T^{n})+2\, (F^1F^2\cdots F^n)
\ee
where $(\,\cdots)$ indicates an internal contraction over the $YY$ and $\bar{Z}Z$ loops. Plugging in the Feynman rule of \eqn{eq:FeynmanRuleYYZ} and \eqn{eq:FeynmanRuleXZZ}, we can readily obtain expressions in terms of the internal loop factors $l_i$ and the external momenta $k_i$ (we define the $l_i$ loop momentum as that flowing into $k_i$ and out of $k_{i-1}$):
\be
N_{(12...n)}^{\text{NLSM}}=(T^{1}T^{2}\cdots T^{n}) = (l_1 k_1)(l_2 k_2) \cdots (l_n k_n)
\ee
and similarly so for the internal vector contribution:
\be
 (F^1F^2\cdots F^n) = (D-4)(l_1 k_1)(l_2 k_2) \cdots (l_n k_n) + \mathcal{O}(D^0)
\ee
The dimension dependent factor essentially counts that number of internal vector states. While this $n$-gon is manifestly color-dual, it does not produce the right cuts for NLSM. However, the scalar contribution, that comes dressed with an overall factor $(D-4)$ \textit{does} manifest the duality globally, and satisfies all the desired pion cuts. In order for the Feynman rules for $Y\!Z$ theory compute one-loop color-dual numerators consistent with NLSM cuts, we must add some additional states to cancel off he spurious poles, while preserving color-kinematics duality. We leave this as a direction of future work. 

While the $\bar{Z}Z$ vector loop spoils color-kinematics off-shell, the $Y\!Z$ loop alone gives us a desired expression for the $n$-gon. The important takeaway is that we now have a guess for the form of the off-shell three-point vertex that has a chance of manifesting the duality off-shell. The $n$-gon numerator above has scalar insertions of the following kinematic vertex:
\be
T^{a}_{LR} = k_a(l_L-l_{R}) = (l_L+l_{R}) (l_L-l_{R})  = l_L^2-l_{R}^2 
\ee
Given this structure, in the next section we will attempt to construct two-loop basis diagrams from these cubic vertex assignments and try to reverse engineer the particle content that produces these master numerators.

Before proceeding, we note a strange property of the $n$-gon numerator for the pions. In this form, Jacobi relations produce \textit{non-vanishing} values for bubbles on external legs (BELs). However, it is easy to see that the contribution integrates to zero after applying IBP relations/tensor reduction on the bubble. The BEL diagram can be reconstructed from the $n$-gon as follows:
\be
N^{\text{BEL}}_{1|2,34} = N^{\text{NLSM}}_{(1234,l)}-N^{\text{NLSM}}_{(1243,l)}-N^{\text{NLSM}}_{(1342,l)}+N^{\text{NLSM}}_{(1432,l)}
\ee
where we define the loop momentum to be in between the left most and right most leg on the box. Plugging in particular values for $l_i$, we obtain the following expression for the BEL
\be
N^{\text{BEL}}_{1|2,34} = s_{12} (l+k_1)^2 l^{\mu} k_1^{\nu} k_2^{[\mu} k_{[34]}^{\nu]} 
\ee
Notice there is an overall factor that cancels one of the propagators. Plugging this in, produces an integral of the following form
\be
\mathcal{I}^{\text{BEL}}_{1|2,34} = s_{12} k_1^{\nu} k_2^{[\mu} k_{[34]}^{\nu]} \int \frac{d^D l}{i\pi^{D/2}} \frac{l^\mu }{l^2-\mu^2} \sim   s_{12}(s_{13}-s_{14}) (\mu^2)^{D/2}
\ee
where we have introduced a mass regulator that will be proportional the the on-shell momentum inside the BEL, $\mu^2 \equiv k_1^2$. Thus, in large enough dimension, this integral suppresses the $\mu^{-2}$ divergence appearing in the denominator of the BEL diagram. 

\section{Two-loop}

\subsection{Notes to self}
\begin{itemize}
\item We should comment on 1-loop YM.  Can you easily write down the $n$-gon numerator?  I have some memory that someone has some complicated YM numerator.
\item Are you sure that the SDYM EOM doesn't come from just $F=\epsilon F$?  If $A=\partial \Phi$ then $F$ has the right number of derivatives to give the SDYM EOM but $DF$ has too many.
\item I believe the j-theory Lagrangian does not lead to the correct EOM as currently written.
\item Write Lagrangian for j-theory and reiterate the argument about why you know it's pions.  Reiterate connection to ZM (dualize j and integrate in phi).  Should probably mention CS somewhere.  Point out that all of the theories that come from have CK are really some version of YM where you (1) impose some condition like F=0 or some other condition on the field strength and (2) you impose Lorenz gauge.
\item Explain why you need to take a certain portion of the YZ numerator to get the right answer.  Basically you can't have a vector particle circle the loop -- NLSM is a scalar theory so only scalar DOF should actually live in cuts.  If you have a tree then you plug in longitudinal modes but if you have a loop then you really need to remove vector modes so that only scalars circle the loop.
\item Reiterate that the (tree) amplitudes of CS and SDYM are zero.
\item ZM and 2D NLSM (PCM) are the same classically but not quantum mechanically.
This observation is due to other people but an easy way to see it.
ZM and 2D NLSM have the same EOM after a field redefinition.
This means that the classical physics is the same but of course the Lagrangians aren't the same and the field redefinition can change the path integral measure.
\item Forcing pions to match ZM in 2D does funny things.
The pion coupling constant is dropped but is implicitly set by the ordered 4pt amplitude which is normalized to be $-k_1 \cdot k_3$ in the package.
I've tabulated what happens when you take a general D NLSM answer and force it to match ZM in 2D.
Let's say that $n_\text{NLSM} = z n_\text{ZM}$ in 2D where I'm matching basis/master numerators.
For 4pt tree, $z=2/3$ (I matched the half ladder).
For 4pt 1-loop, $z$ is free/pure generalized gauge (I matched the box).
For 4pt 2-loop (when you impose certain $\ell$ power counting) $z$ is $216/565=\tfrac{2^3 3^3}{5 \cdot 113}$ (I matched the double box and penta-triangle).
For 6pt tree, $z$ is 12/35 (I matched the half ladder).
So you can match kinematic structure (the combination of Mandelstams) of NLSM to ZM in 2D but you can't get the coupling constant right at loop level, that is, ZM is a different theory quantum mechanically.
Actually these numbers make it look like you can't even match the theories classically but I guess for the theories to match classically you only need the amplitudes to agree and I matched numerators.
\item Explain how matching to ZM is a little silly.
Check that NLSM and ZM numerator agree on cuts.
Can't do that or else it becomes subtle.
Only well defined object is numerator.
\item At 4pt 1-loop $\prod p_L^2 -p_R^2$ agrees with the ZM answer $\prod p_L \eps p_R$ up to some number.
At 6pt 1-loop this is not true and the two answers differ by alternating signs depending on the kinematic configuration.
\item You cannot lift ZM to general D NLSM in the democratic way that Nic described because it fails at 6pt tree.
\item To clean up the NLSM 4pt 2-loop answer I forced the answer to match ZM in 2D.
The ZM answer also only has certain powers of loop momenta $\ell^5$...$\ell^8$ where $\ell$ represents any combination of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$.
I enforce this $\ell^5$...$\ell^8$ behavior on the NLSM ansatz too.
\item Describe Jacobi:  s,t,u channel color factors sum to zero so you want numerators to do the same
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pions -- James}

As we have seen, it is possible to coerce tree numerators into 1-loop numerators at any multiplicity for pions.
However, these methods cannot be reapplied to generate 2-loop numerators, which begs the question ``is it possible to find globally color-dual numerators beyond 1-loop''.
By ``global'' we mean that color-kinematics duality is satisfied in any kinematic configuration of the integrand.
This is a much more stringent condition than absolutely necessary.
There is reason to believe (cite Zvi et al) that global numerators cannot always be found.
One resolution to the issue is to only demand color-kinematics duality on the unitarity cuts of the integrand, i.e., in specific kinematic limits.
Enforcing Jacobi on the cuts is enough to ensure that the squared integrand will correctly cut to gravity (or whatever the squared theory might be).
When a globally color-dual numerator cannot be found, another alternative explored in the literature is to increase the size of the numerator ansatz by enlarging the numerator from a polynomial to a rational function with spurious singularities (cite Donal et al).
When global color-kinematics fails, the hope is that it can be restored by enlarging the size of the ansatz, either by giving the numerator of each graph its own ansatz (first option described) or by promoting the numerator to a non-local function (second option described).
Note that a theory whose Lagrangian has color-kinematics duality would naturally produce a globally color-dual integrand so the quest for a global numerator is closely related to the existence of a Lagrangian exhibiting color-kinematics duality.
We will begin by tackling the issue of a global 4pt 2-loop numerator for NLSM before moving on to YM.
Two-loop color-dual integrands for pure YM have been investigated before but only for a limited ansatz that manifests locality (cite Zvi et al paper).

Aside from a few special theories (cite blah), color-dual integrands are constructed from an ansatz.
Color-kinematics duality is stated in terms of cubic graphs so the first step is to express in the integrand in terms of such graphs.
Naively there are 14 cubic 4pt 2-loop topologies ignoring tadpoles and bubble on external leg (BEL) graphs.
It is always possible to express an integrand in terms of cubic graphs, even for an even valency theory like NLSM, by multiplying and dividing the integrand by factors of inverse propagators.
Next, the ansatz must have the correct power counting and external states.
Since pions are scalars the numerators will not carry any spinors or polarization vectors.
Every vertex in NLSM scales as $k^2$ so, for example, the numerator of a cubic 4pt 2-loop diagram scales as $k^{12}$ so there are 8,008 independent dot products of momenta at this mass dimension.
The numerator is assumed to be manifestly local but one approach to finding color-dual numerators is to relax manifest locality, see (...) for more details.
After zeroth order considerations like power counting, there are three conditions that are imposed on the ansatz: (1) Jacobi relations amongst graphs must be satisfied, (2) numerators must respect graph symmetries, and (3) the integrand must have the correct unitarity cuts.

\subsubsection{Jacobi relations}

Jacobi relations are the heart of color-kinematics duality.
The color factors in an integrand obey a set of Jacobi identities.
Color-kinematics duality states that there exists a way of writing the kinematic numerators of the integrand so that they obey the same set of Jacobi identities.
(Can trivially read off the adjoint color factors from a cubic graph.)
So if any triplet of graphs is related by a Jacobi identity, so too must their numerators.
Broadly speaking there are two kinds of Jacobi identities.
The first kind relate graphs to a basis.
For example, the double box, crossed box, and penta-triangle are related to each other as follows
\be % [[11]]
\label{eq:TwoLoopJacobiOne}
\JacobiOneDoubleBox +  \JacobiOneCrossedBox + \JacobiOnePentaTriangle =0.
\ee
where the shared propagator is shown in red.
Using this relation the crossed box can be written in terms of the other two.
In this way, all of the 14 cubic 4pt 2-loop topologies can be written in terms of a basis of the double box and penta-triangle.
(Any two of the double box, crossed box, and penta-triangle would have sufficed for a basis but the planar basis was chosen for simplicity.)
Each of the two basis graphs receives its own numerator ansatz and the numerator of any other graph can be expressed in terms of these.
As mentioned before, there are 8,008 linearly independent dot products of momenta of the required mass dimension so the total number of free parameters in the system is 16,016.
As this is too many parameters for \texttt{Mathematica} to reasonably handle, we employ a custom solver suitable for the moderately dense systems appearing in this context.
(Scalars might generate denser systems since ever dot product can interfere with every other unlike gauge theories which separate based on polarization structure, can cite Nic.)

The second kind of Jacobi relations relate basis elements to themselves.
For example, the crossed box numerator is related to itself via the following Jacobi relation
\be % [[19]]
\label{eq:TwoLoopJacobiTwo}
\JacobiTwoCrossedBoxOne + \JacobiTwoCrossedBoxTwo +  \JacobiTwoCrossedBoxThree =0,
\ee
where the shared propagator is shown in red as before.
Each of the crossed box numerators can be represented in terms of the double box and penta-triangle so this Jacobi relation places constraints on the basis numerator ansatze.
The first kind of Jacobi relations simplifies how many numerators require ansatze whereas the second kind of Jacobi relations place constraints on the remaining numerators.
In principle there could be Jacobi relations involving tadpoles and BEL graphs, which would be subtle to handle.
One option is to force the numerators of these graphs to zero.
However, since these graphs will not contribute to physical unitarity cuts, we take a different approach.
These graphs are allowed to have non-zero numerators but any Jacobi relations involving them are simply not imposed or solved.
See (4 loop N=4 paper) for a discussion of BELs in the context of color-kinematics duality.

In total, there are 21 Jacobi relations on the 14 cubic 4pt 2-loop graphs where, again, tadpole and BEL graphs are ignored.
How many constraints fixed.

\subsubsection{Graph symmetries}

The second key constraint in an ansatz construction of color-dual numerators comes from graph symmetries.
Every numerator is required to respect all of the symmetries (or automorphisms) of its associated graph.
While it is very convenient to impose graph symmetries, it is not completely necessary in order to perform the double copy.
At tree level, finding manifestly color dual numerators is often achieved at the expense of manifest Bose symmetry (see YZ theory, j-theory, Alex numerators from CHY, Henrik numerators).
Nonetheless, for a pure ansatz construction it is very reasonable to impose graph symmetries.
Note that the graph symmetry constraint is imposed on \emph{every} graph, not just the basis graphs.
For example, the crossed box, as shown in \eqref{eq:TwoLoopJacobiTwo}, is unchanged upon reflection across the horizontal axis.
Since the crossed box can be written in terms of the double box and penta-triangle, this imposes non-trivial constraints on the ansatz.

Imposing graph symmetries on the ansatz further reduces the DOF to ...

\subsubsection{Unitarity}

The last key constraint is that the ansatz have the correct unitarity cuts, that is, that the integrand corresponds to the correct theory.
The essence of generalized unitarity is that when internal lines are placed on-shell, the integrand should factorize into a product of on-shell tree amplitudes.
Generalized unitarity has been reviewed in many places (cite...) so we will not belabor the details here.

Could mention that it is certainly enough to check $(n-2)!$ color-ordered cuts but you could maybe get away with 


Finally we have to impose unitarity.
We only do physical cuts, no aesthetic cuts.
The two most important cuts for pions (or any EMU) are ...
These cuts are the only non-zero cuts.
However there are other cuts that must be imposed as well like the max cut.

Show the two interesting cuts, mention a max cut

How many DOF left after imposing cuts

Could bake in max cuts to slightly reduce ansatz size.

References for Jacobi, unitarity, etc.

After you've imposed all of the essential stuff you get X free parameters...
There is lots of generalized gauge freedom, clearly there's room to impose extra constraints.
For N=4 the extra conditions are things like no triangles, strip off a factor of stAtree (which fails at 5-loops), manifest power counting, etc.
The obvious choice here is to match to ZM.
There's one known theory that has manifest color-kinematics, manifest Bose sym, and NLSM power counting and that's ZM theory.

\subsubsection{Matching to ZM and loop power counting -- James}

Can simplify the garbage

ZM plagued by (suffers from) IR regulation issues.
Only one of the two physical/meaningful cuts can be done in a non-subtle way.
We're using ZM more as a tool to... -- We know ZM has the right kinematic structure to give CK in 2D so we're just matching onto that because we can.  ZM and NLSM can be different at quantum level.
