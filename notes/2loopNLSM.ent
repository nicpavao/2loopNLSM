macro:->The
four
ansatz
conditions
are
similar
to
those
of
Ref.~\cite
{Bern:2015ooa}
except
that
there
the
authors
demand
that
the
numerators
have
the
same
loop
power
counting
as
Feynman
gauge
Feynman
rules.
This
is
an
additional
assumption
that
is
most
emphatically
not
made
here.

macro:->\texttt
{Mathematica}
is
not
suited
to
equations
with
sixteen
thousand
parameters
so
a
different
method
is
desirable.
One
possibility
is
to
use
a
solver
designed
for
integral
reduction.
However,
these
solvers
typically
assume
that
the
matrix
has
a
very
low
density
which
is
not
the
case
for
equations
coming
from
NLSM
which
typically
have
a
density
of
a
few
percent.
While
the
equations
in
YM
naturally
separate
into
different
``helicity''
sectors
(or
$e_i
\cdot
e_j$
and
$e_i
\cdot
k_j$
sectors
in
$D$
dimensions),
there
is
no
such
separation
of
sectors
in
a
scalar
theory
where
any
product
of
momenta
can
interfere
with
any
other.
The
NLSM
constraint
equations
were
solved
using
a
custom
solver,
\texttt
{FiniteFieldSolve},
designed
to
solve
large
linear
systems
of
arbitrary
density.
\texttt
{FiniteFieldSolve}
will
be
released
publicly
shortly.\ace

want
to
rephrase
this
slightly,
but
need
to
think
about
it
a
bit
more}
